\title{Calculate the population size within length bins}
\usage{
Rpop_len(node, wt, Len, Zki, Galpha, Gbeta)
}
\arguments{
\item{node}{Nodes for the Gauss-Laguerre quadrature rule}

\item{wt}{Weights for the Gauss-Laguerre quadrature rule}

\item{Len}{Vector of lower-bounds for length intervals}

\item{Zki}{Vector of total mortality (in time units of growth rate
parameter K) to be applied in each length interval. This vector should be
the same length as Len}

\item{Galpha}{Alpha parameter for the Gamma probability density function that
governs growth variability.}

\item{Gbeta}{Rate parameter for the Gamma distribution growth variability
(=Galpha/Linf)}
}
\value{
A vector of population size in each length bin
}
\description{
The model integrates over growth rate variability and sums mortality
piece-wise over intervening length intervals to derive the relative
population number in each length bin taking into account variation in growth
and varying mortality-at-length. This is analogous to an age based catch
curve model, but for length. The model uses the Gauss-Laguerre quadrature
rule for integration, so nodes and weights for this must be provided. This
function is the same as \link{Rpop_F}, but does not return fishing mortality and
is written in R.

\examples{
glq <- statmod::gauss.quad(90, kind = "laguerre", alpha = 0.0)
S <- Rpop_len(glq$nodes, glq$weights, Len=15:55,
              Zki=c(rep(1.5, 10), rep(3, 31)), 100, 100/50)
plot(y=S, x=15:55, type="l")
