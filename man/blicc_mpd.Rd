\title{Finds Bayesian length interval catch curve maximum posterior density point}
\usage{
blicc_mpd(blicc_ld)
}
\arguments{
\item{blicc_ld}{A standard data list suitable for the model
(see function \code{blicc_dat()})}
}
\value{
A tibble of parameter estimates (mpd) with standard errors.
}
\description{
The maximum posterior density point is found using on the likelihood for the
length frequency data and the priors.  The model assumes constant
recruitment, double-sided normal selectivity, a single natural mortality
parameter, and Gamma-distributed von Bertalanffy growth to define expected
numbers of fish in pre-defined length bins. The model also assumes
a negative binomial likelihood function to fit to a single
length frequency sample. Selectivity, mortality, asymptotic mean length and
scale parameters are fitted to generate the spawning potential ratio as a
measure of the stock status.
}
\details{
Unlike \code{blicc_fit()}, the model finds a point estimate. This is much faster
than the MCMC, but does not provide full information on uncertainty.
The model estimates mortality and survival through sequential length
intervals. This is then used to derive abundance and catch in numbers within
each length bin. The mortality is required to remain constant within each
bin, but otherwise can vary arbitrarily. However, in this implementation
mortality is constrained by a parametric model with constant natural
mortality by length and a double-sided normal selectivity function for
fishing mortality. See \code{blicc_dat()} and \code{blicc_fit()} documentation for
a description of the model and data requirements.

The standard errors are estimated from 1000 random draws from a multivariate
normal with mean at the MPD mode and covariance estimated from the inverted
Hessian matrix. This is an approximation and SE estimates may differ from
the full MCMC sampling.

In addtion to the parameters, the fit reports the spawning potential ratio
(SPR) and the log probability at the mode (lp__).
