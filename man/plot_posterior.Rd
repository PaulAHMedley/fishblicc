\title{Plot the observed and expected length frequency data}
\usage{
plot_posterior(blicc_rp, gear = "All", time_period = "All")
}
\arguments{
\item{blicc_rp}{A list of posterior draws, reference points with associated
direction, the data object and expected lengths from \link{blicc_ref_pts}
function.}

\item{gear}{Specifies the gear(s) to plot as an integer index or full name}

\item{time_period}{Specifies the period(s) to plot as an integer index or
full name}
}
\value{
ggplot geom object plotting observed and expected frequency
}
\description{
The graph shows the observed length frequency and the posterior predicted
frequency for the specified gears. The plots include the 80\% credible
intervals for the estimate (if an MCMC is provided) and 80\% credible
intervals for the observations. The latter takes into account the negative
binomial observation error, so on average 8 out of ten observations would be
expected within these bounds.
